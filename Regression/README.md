# 🏡 Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project uses a neural network to predict housing prices in Boston using the classic Boston Housing dataset. Built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🔍 Dataset

The Boston Housing dataset includes 506 samples and 13 features such as:
- Average number of rooms per dwelling
- Proportion of residential land zoned
- Crime rate per capita
- Distance to employment centers

Target: **Median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s)**

## 🧠 Model

- **Architecture**: neural network 
- **Loss function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Optimizer**: rmsprop
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras

## 📈 Results

- Trained for 20 epochs
- MSE converged to around 12.2124  (fill in)
