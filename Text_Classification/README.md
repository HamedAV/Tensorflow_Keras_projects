# Climate Change Prediction using Jena Climate Dataset (2009-2016)
## 📊 Project Overview
This project implements deep learning models to predict climate patterns using the Jena Climate 2009-2016 time series dataset. The analysis employs both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to forecast climate variables and understand climate change trends.
🌡️ Dataset
Jena Climate Dataset (2009-2016)

Source: Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany
Time Period: 2009-2016 (8 years of continuous measurements)
